# Gailbot-Tools

## About

[Gailbot](https://github.com/HiLabTufts/gailbot) is named after [Gail Jefferson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gail_Jefferson), inventor of the transcription system used for [Conversation Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation_analysis). She can generate a first pass at a transcript that can then be improved manually.

The tools in this repository are designed to analyze Gailbot generated transcripts. However,their use might be further extended to any transcripts following the [CAlite](https://github.com/saulalbert/CABNC/wiki/CHAT-CA-lite) or [CLAN/CHAT](http://dali.talkbank.org/clan/) transcription formats.
