Project : CHAT_XML Unidirectional Converter
Language : Python


-- AIM --
- The aim of this project is to create, at first, a unidirectional converter 
between the CHAT and XML formats.
- The XML will be a standard format for all files such that the Human 
Interaction Lab has a standardized way ton convert Gailbot files to XML.


-- Problems and Motivation --

- Currently, TalkBank's 'Chatter' script is available on their website 
(https://talkbank.org/software/chatter.html).

- The problem is that CHATTER does not work with most CHAT transcripts in the 
CANBC and HI-LAB Corpus because it performs a strict format check on the 
transcipts. The problem is that most of these transcripts have extra unicode
symbol added as part of newer transcription standards (such as CAlite).
- Thus, Chatter is not able to do any conversion.


-- DESIGN --

- The initial aim of this program is to have a standard XML conversion format
(with standard tags) based on what already exists in CHATTER.

- The XML schema for the CHAT files can be found at:
      https://talkbank.org/software/xsddoc/

- The original plan was to re-write CHATTER (Talkbank's existing CHAT to XML
      converter) based on the original schema. However, the new converter would
      not perform strong contect checking and allow conversion to XML even if 
      the transcribed utterances did not strictly adhere to the CHAT format.
      However, it was decided that doing so would create major inconsistencies 
      between new and old CHAT files and eventually cause format errors.

- Thus, a new plan was adopted to re-use the CHATTER script, allow it to perform
      strict syntax checking, and produce XML files. However, we decided to 
      refine the transcripts to minimally remove illegal syntax from the 
      transcripts before executing CHATTER. 
      CHATTER's output can then be used to recursively remove parts of the 
      transcript that remain illegal.

-- TRADEOFFS --

- Major problems include:
      1. Having no concrete way to indicate where the data wwas deleted in the 
            XML files.
      2. Data loss as a result of removing illegal utterances.

- Benifits include:
      1. Using a standard and existing conversion schema.
      2. Using an existing converter that conforms to the schema AND performs
            syntax validation.
      3. Generating standard XML files.



-- CHANGELOG --

- No changes to report.
